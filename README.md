## Notes
1. Don't modify movement actions (jumps, dashes, backflips, etc.), as this is potentially detectable.
2. Some combinations of actions can't be swapped because their structure doesn't quite line up (for example, one might have a `.pap` animation file associated with, while another does not)
3. Seriously, don't modify movement actions
